GNOME Shell extension which counts the days since i stopped smoking, just to hype me up.

The counter tracks the number of days since the date specified at the top of `extension.js` until today.

This is also a great example of a custom-built GNOME Shell extension.

### did you stop smoking and run GNOME? 
1. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/guidoenr/inolongersmoke`
2. rename and move it `cp ./inolongersmoke ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/inolongersmoke@guidoenr`
3. restart gnome with `ALT + F2` and type `r` or `restart`
