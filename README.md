GNOME Shell extension which counts the days since i stopped smoking, just to hype me up.

This is also a good example of a own-built extension.

### you stopped smoking and you run GNOME? 
1. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/guidoenr/inolongersmoke`
2. change repo name and move it`cp ./inolongersmoke ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/inolongersmoke@guidoenr`
3. restart gnome with `ALT + F2` and type `r` or `restart`
